This is a sample blog post. Lorem ipsum I can't remember the rest of lorem ipsum and don't have an internet connection right now. Testing testing testing this blog post. Blog posts are cool.

Headings are cool
======
$$
f(\lambda)=\text{e}^{\lambda A}B\text{e}^{-\lambda A}
$$

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}=\text{e}^A [A, B] \text{e}^{-A}
$$

You can have many headings
======

Aren't headings cool?

Temperature and the Zeroth Law
======
Equilibrium
------
**The zeroth law of thermodynamics**: _Two systems, each separately in thermal equilibrium with a third, are in
equilibrium with each other._



A Statistical Definition of Temperature
------
Two systems are only to exchange energy between themselves. A system will appear to choose a macroscopic configuration that maximizes the number of microstates. This idea is based on the following assumptions:
1. Each one of the possible microstates of a system is equally likely to occur;
2. The systemâ€™s internal dynamics are such that the microstates of the system are continually changing;
3. Given enough time, the system will explore all possible microstates and spend an equal time in each of them.

For our problem of two connected systems, the most probable di- vision of energy between the two systems is the one that maximizes $\Omega_1(E_1)\Omega_2(E_2)$, because this will correspond to the greatest number of possible microstates.

$$\begin{aligned}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}E_1}\left[\Omega_1(E_1)\Omega_2(E_2)\right]&=  \Omega(E_2)\frac{\mathrm{d}\Omega(E_1)}{\mathrm{d}E_1}+\Omega(E_1)\frac{\mathrm{d}\Omega(E_2)}{\mathrm{d}E_2}\frac{\mathrm{d}E_2}{\mathrm{d}E_1}\\
	&=\Omega_2\frac{\mathrm{d}\Omega_1}{\mathrm{d}E_1}-\Omega_1\frac{\mathrm{d}\Omega_2}{\mathrm{d}E_2}=0
	\end{aligned}$$

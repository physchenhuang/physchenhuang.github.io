Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm excited to introduce myself - My name is Chen Huang. I'm a recent graduate from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and soon to study at Imperial College London. My major is in Physics, and my research interests are focused on quantum information and quantum computing. I'm particularly passionate about ion trap quantum computing and the exciting possibilities it holds for the future. ðŸ”¬

When I'm not busy exploring the mysteries of the universe, you can find me pursuing my hobbies. I love traveling to new places and capturing my adventures through photography. ðŸ“· 

I'm thrilled to be embarking on this new academic journey, and I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for physics and quantum computing. Let's explore the quantum world together! ðŸŒŒ

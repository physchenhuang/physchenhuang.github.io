Hello everyone! 👋 I'm so excited to introduce you to my academic website, [**Chen's Physics World**](https://physchenhuang.github.io/)! 🌎 My name is Chen Huang 🍊, and I'm a recent Physics graduate from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and soon to be studying at Imperial College London. I'm thrilled to share with you all the amazing resources and insights that I've gained throughout my academic journey so far. 🤓

In the [NOTES](https://physchenhuang.github.io/notes/) section of my website, you can find all of my notes from my undergraduate studies, including study notes 📚, literature notes 📖, and more! 📝 I believe that sharing knowledge is essential for growth, so I hope that these notes can be helpful to anyone who is interested in the subjects that I've studied. 🌟

Additionally, you can also check out some of my presentations in [TALKS](https://physchenhuang.github.io/talks/) 🎤, which cover a range of topics from my research to my personal experiences. I love exploring new ideas and presenting them in a clear and concise way, and I hope that you find these presentations to be informative and engaging. 🤩

In the [BLOG](https://physchenhuang.github.io/blog/) section, you'll find some of my musings and inspiration that I've gathered along the way. As someone who is passionate about physics and quantum computing, I love exploring new ideas and concepts, and I hope that some of my posts will spark your curiosity as well. 🤔

And of course, no academic website would be complete without a personal [CV](https://physchenhuang.github.io/cv/)! 📄 I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so feel free to reach out if you think that we might be a good fit! 🤝

Thanks for taking the time to visit my website, and I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals who share my passion for physics and quantum computing. Let's explore the wonders of the quantum world together! 🚀🌌
